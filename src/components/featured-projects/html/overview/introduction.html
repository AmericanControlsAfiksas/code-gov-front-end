<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>While different government agencies have varying missions and mandates, they tend to have some similar technology needs. For instance, most agencies maintain at least one website; many agencies use eligibility, application, and case management systems; and some agencies have APIs to allow members of the public and other agencies to access their data.</p>
<p>Now that there are thousands of repositories listed on code.gov, it can sometimes be hard to find what youâ€™re looking for. <strong>These lists are meant to curate projects for common government use cases that are well documented, architected for reusability, and/or popular among open source contributors.</strong> By highlighting these projects, the code.gov team is hoping to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Help government market researchers find existing projects they can potentially either reuse instead of procuring completely new software or use to build an MVP to validate initial assumptions about a potential product</li>
    <li>Provide inspiration to developers working on government software about how to build modern, open-source software</li>
    <li>Promote open source contributions to federal code from members of the public</li>
    <li>Break down silos between agencies so that they can create reusable and interoperable systems</li>
    <li>Document known cases of reuse of existing federal code among agencies as well as other national, state, and local governments</li>     
</ul>
<p><em>These lists are a constant work in progress. If you want to suggest a new category or a new repository for these featured projects or if you notice any incorrect information, please email <a href="mailto:code@gsa.gov">code@gsa.gov.</a></em></p>
